# Basic Arithmetic Operations:
Implement four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# Operational Buttons:
Include operational buttons for each arithmetic operation (e.g., +, -, *, /).
Implement equals (=) button to execute the calculation.

# Clear and Reset:
Provide buttons to clear the input fields and reset the calculator for new calculations.

# Error Handling:
Implement error handling for scenarios like division by zero or invalid input.

# Memory Functions:
Optionally include memory functions (e.g., M+, M-, MR, MC) for storing and recalling values.

# Keyboard Support:
Allow users to input numbers and perform operations using both the mouse and keyboard.
